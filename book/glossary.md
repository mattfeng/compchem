- **multiplicity.** $\text{multiplicity} = U + 1$, where ${U}$ is the number of unpaired electrons. This is because the number of unique ways to arrange electron spins is equivalent to counting the number of unpaired electrons with spin up, which is $|\{0, 1, 2, ..., U\}| = U + 1$.
- **self-consistent field (SCF).**
