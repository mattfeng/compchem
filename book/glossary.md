# Glossary

- **multiplicity.** Multiplicity ($M$) is given the number of unique ways to arrange electron spins.
  - equivalent to counting the number of unpaired electrons with spin up, which is $|\\{0, 1, 2, ..., U\\}| = U + 1$.
- **self-consistent field (SCF).**

- **HF**. Hartree-Fock
- **UHF**. Unrestricted Hartree-Fock
- **CCSD(T)**. Coupled cluster single-double and perturbative triple 
- **CASSCF**. Complete active space SCF method (multiconfigurational self-consistent field).
- **B3LYP**. Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr, hybrid functional
